## About The Project

This project is a multi-user airline reservation system designed to simulate the complex operations of a real-world airline. It provides distinct interfaces and functionalities for different user roles, all managed through a centralized backend and database. The architecture emphasizes security, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns, with parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection attacks and a modular structure for easy maintenance.

## ✨ Key Features

The system is designed with four distinct user roles, each with a tailored set of permissions and features:

### 👤 For Customers
- **Flight Search:** Search for available flights by source, destination, and date.
- **Ticket Purchasing:** Securely book and purchase tickets for selected flights.
- **Booking History:** View a complete history of all past and upcoming flights.
- **📊 Spending Tracker:** Monitor purchase history and view monthly spending reports to manage travel budgets.

### 🧑‍💼 For Booking Agents
- **Book for Customers:** Search and book flights on behalf of registered customers.
- **📈 Commission Dashboard:** Track commission earnings from ticket sales in real-time within a specified date range.
- **Top Customer Analytics:** Identify and view top customers based on the number of tickets purchased or commission generated.

### ✈️ For Airline Staff
- **Complete Flight Management:** Create, update, and manage flight schedules, including changing flight statuses (e.g., delayed, on-time).
- **Fleet & Airport Management:** Add new airplanes and airports to the system to expand the airline's network.
- **User & Permission Control:** Approve new staff/agent accounts and grant specific operational permissions.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports on ticket sales, total revenue, and popular destinations to drive business decisions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (3.9+ recommended)
- MySQL Server
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Set up the MySQL Database:**
    - Start your MySQL server.
    - Create a new database for the project (e.g., `airline_db`).
    - Import the database schema and initial data from the `air.sql` file:
      ```sh
      mysql -u your_mysql_user -p your_database_name < air.sql
      ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Open the `config.py` file.
    - Update the database connection settings (username, password, database name) to match your local MySQL setup.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
